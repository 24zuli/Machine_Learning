Machine Learning(ML)ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

What is ML:-
-> It enable computers to learn from the data and take decisions like humans or make predictions without any explicit program.

Types of ML:-
1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised Learning
3) Reinforcement Learning

1) Supervised Learning:-
-> Models can predict the answers after seeing a lots of data with the correct answer.

There are two categories of Supervised Learning..

i) Regression:-
-> Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
-> Predicts the continuos numerical values.

Regression Models:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

ii) Classification:-
-> Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories.
-> It recognize the entities from the dataset and conclude with likelihood of that entity.

Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
